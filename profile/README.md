# Fortio

Fortio holds the "swiss army knife" style, high quality, low dependencies Golang networking library and utilities.

Started as just for fortio itself but as some package usability became more general (ie dynamic flags, CLI and server CLI shells, sets, logger etc...) 
we moved them to toplevel packages.
